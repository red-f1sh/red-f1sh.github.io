        <h2>IATSU FIRST YEAR STUDENT GUIDE</h2>

        <h3>project synopsis</h3>

        <p>
          This was a project initially created for a collaboration between IATSU and
          the SIAT advising team. This was an individual design project while the rest
          of the IATSU team would provide feedback.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>timeframe:</em> three months
        </p>

        <p>
          This project was to create a helpful guide for incoming students to have a better
          understanding of our program and to be able to navigate around important
          areas of our school campus. Our team initially decided to hand out this guide
          to first year students during Welcome Day, a day for new students to tour around
          the campus and get to know other students.

        <h3>tools used</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>CLIP STUDIO PAINT PRO</li>
          <li>Adobe Indesign</li>
          <li>Adobe Illustrator</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="box">
        <h3>brainstorming</h3>
        <p>
          In order to make a useful guide, I decided to come up with specific topics that
          could be covered. Although I had personal experience, I thought it would be
          useful to have other students give input on what they wanted to know in their
          first year. I have found that many students have trouble finding resources
          within our campus despite hearing about them, making it difficult for them to
          utilize these resources to their advantage. There are also first year mentoring
          programs that are not promoted enough for student traction.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to this, I wanted to include a section to help new students learn
          helpful tips for any projects and assignments within our program. For this, I had
          requested our team president to email professors in our faculty to provide any
          insight they wish to give students.

        <h3>challenges</h3>
        <p>
          One major challenge I encountered was the lack of a coherent map of the campus
          other than the one provided via the university website. Even though this was
          an official map, there was a problem with readability as it had too much information
          to swallow.
        </p>

        <img src="img/iatsu/process/map1.jpg">

        <img src="img/iatsu/process/map2.jpeg">
        <figcaption>original map of Podium 3 provided by Simon Fraser University</figcaption>

        <p>
          There are three studio spaces used by students called Studios A, B, and C respectively,
          however, they are not labeled as such in the original map provided. Another problem
          was the size of the map, since I was only focusing on select parts of the area, it would
          be unreasonable to use the full map, but I found that it would be difficult to
          navigate by using only parts of the map. To combat this, I decided to specify
          specific landmarks near the highlighted rooms.
        </p>

        <p>
          As shown above, I rendered the map with vector lines, creating a cleaner design
          as well as showcasing a distinct walkway to navigate to these spaces. I marked
          important locations with a different colour in order to focus on these areas.
          I wanted to keep hallways recognizable for a student walking through them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another problem I encountered was the amount of information to be included.
          In my initial brainstorming process, I found that there was a lot of
          important information and resources to be covered, and it was difficult to keep
          all of it in a compact booklet. To keep from overwhelming the reader from
          an abundance of information, I asked fellow students a survey question:
          <em>what did they wish they knew in their first year?</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          I found that many students wished they knew more about student consultation
          groups and events happening around the faculty. Therefore I decided to focus
          the guide on various extracurricular programs outside of courses to enhance
          the first year experience, such as the TechTeams program, information on
          our student union, and various student organizations lookng for designers.

        <h3>final product</h3>

        <p>
          Due to time constraints, the IATSU team had voted to pull out of the collaboration
          and instead distribute the student guide on our own.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because of funding issues, the IATSU team was unable to print an adequate
          amount of booklets to hand out to all first years. However, we able to
          give some to various students during a Clubs Day exhibition. The students
          who received these guides found the guides very helpful and friendly.
