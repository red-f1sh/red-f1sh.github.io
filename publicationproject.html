        <h2>PUB332 PUBLICATION PROJECT</h2>

        <img src="img/design/PUB332/XCU-cover.png">

        <p>
          For the course PUB332: Graphic Design in Transition: Print and Digital Periodicals,
          I was tasked with creating a pitch for a magazine publication concept, as well
          as creating a cover design, feature editorial design, web design mockups, and
          advertisement mockups. This project spanned the entire semester of Spring 2021 and
          simulated the process of establishing a magazine publication in the field.

        </p>

      </div>

      <div class="box">
        <h3>publication concept</h3>

        <p>
          I wanted my magazine brand to cover film topics- for instance, film reviews, upcoming
          feature films, exclusive interviews, and opinion pieces around the social climate
          involving film. I was required to make an editorial mandate, readership guide, and
          a basic branding idea for my pitch.
        </p>

        <img src="img/design/PUB332/PUB332-Readership, Editorial Mandate & Brand Project-3.png">
        <figcaption>readership, editorial mandate, and branding</figcaption>

        <p>
          The brand name I chose for my publication was XCU, a common term used for cinematography.
          XCU stands for extreme close-up, and I thought this was a clever play on words
          in regards to what content I wanted to include within this publication: an extreme
          close up on all things film.
        </p>

        <p>
          I wanted to have a vintage look for the overall magazine, something that mirrors the
          film aesthetic of old cinema. In this initial pitch, I wanted to use sepia tones
          to create an old-timey tone similar to black-and-white films and utilize film stills
          to their potential and really focus on the cinematography shots as means to show
          an appreciation for these details.
        </p>

        <p>
          I later looked into making a Pinterest board to create a proper moodboard to
          take inspiration from.
        </p>

        <img src="img/design/PUB332/moodboard.png">

        <img src="img/design/PUB332/movie posters.png">
        <figcaption>old Hollywood movie posters</figcaption>

        <p>
          With this moodboard, I decided to stray further from the original sepia tone
          and instead adopted a colourful palette. I mainly took inspiration from old Hollywood
          movie posters with the use of exaggerated photo composition and bold, bright colours.
          I found many existing film publications followed a modern art direction, and I
          wanted to move backwards- I wanted to make the publication itself look like something
          out of old Hollywood. I wanted to keep the art direction playful, and take a fun twist
          on existing films with bright, high-contrast images with a touch of text that appears to
          pop out of the page.
        </p>

        <p>
          Something a little cheesy, if you will.
        </p>

        <h3>sketches and thumbnail layouts</h3>

        <img src="img/design/PUB332/layout inspo.png">
        <figcaption>layout inspiration</figcaption>

        <p>
          I've never really done an actual magazine layout before, so I did want to look
          at existing designs to take inspiration from. For the most part, I wanted to
          utilize images to the fullest, and use bright colours in tangent with images
          to have them really look like they're moving across the page.
        </p>

        <img src="img/design/PUB332/edsketch.jpg">

        <figcaption>initial layout sketches</figcaption>

        <p>
          Again, for my layout sketches, I wanted to emphasize images by using big, bold
          images in combination with large lettering. I was really drawn to the large
          signboards used for many old-fashioned theatres with vertical text and I wanted
          to try my hand with something similar for my main feature editorial design.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="box">
        <h3>cover design</h3>

        <p>
          To keep the aesthetic of old film, I also decided to have covers follow a similar
          pattern. Although I don't want to mirror a movie poster design, I still wanted the
          vibe of one, so I chose to only feature one feature story instead of having one main
          cover story and a few sub-features.
        </p>

        <img src="img/design/PUB332/cover1-nogrid.PNG">

        <img src="img/design/PUB332/cover3-nogrid.PNG">
        <figcaption>thumbnail designs for covers</figcaption>

        <p>
          Above, I have three thumbnail designs for potential covers. I wanted to see
          how certain text layouts would look and so I can have a good idea for what images I
          wanted to use. I did include spaces where I can include additional sub-features
          in case I wanted to explore that avenue.
        </p>

        <p>
          I wasn't sure how I wanted to approach the cover design at first, I knew I
          wanted to have it look similar to a movie poster, but I wasn't sure
          what direction I wanted to go towards. So I began with two designs I thought
          would incorporate a more aged design style.
        </p>

        <img src="img/design/PUB332/XCU-cover3.png">
        <img src="img/design/PUB332/XCU-cover32.png">
        <figcaption>initial cover designs</figcaption>

        <p>
          With the first mockup, I followed a more simple approach to text design,
          using only Helvetica for the feature story title. I had also doctored the
          image with filters in order to have a more grainy, film-like appearance.
          However, with this approach the cover appeared somber and more serious, definitely
          not the mood I wanted to go with.
        </p>

        <p>
          With the second cover mockup, I had chosen to include a border and cut out
          parts of the border in order to make parts of the image really pop out. For the
          image, I used a filter to make it look as it were illustrated- this was inspired
          by older movie posters as they were often illustrated instead of photographed.
          The title was actually something I saw from Golden Age Superman comics; they
          often used 3D block text to make the superhero name punch through the page, it
          looked cheesy, and I was looking for cheesy.
        </p>

        <img src="img/design/PUB332/Superman14.jpg">
        <figcaption>it's a bird, it's a plane- no, it's Superman!</figcaption>

        <p>
          But I still wasn't satisfied with the cover. I felt the painterly texture
          I applied to the image takes away from the details of the photo itself.
          It was really lackluster. Instead of using a texture, I decided to focus
          more on saturation and contrast to create that film aesthetic.
        </p>

        <img src="img/design/PUB332/XCU-cover.png">
        <figcaption>final cover design</figcaption>

        <p>
          Although this wasn't mandatory, I also designed an alternative cover to show
          how another issue would appear.
        </p>

        <img src="img/design/PUB332/XCU-cover2.png">

      <div class="box">
        <h3>feature editorial design</h3>

        <p>
          The text I used for the editorial story was actually parts of a <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-features/how-emma-stone-got-her-hollywood-ending-127346/">
            Rolling Stone interview with Emma Stone.</a> Please note that this
            was a requirement for this project to use existing text and not placeholder text (Lorem ipsum).
        </p>

        <img src="img/design/PUB332/XCU Editorial-1.png">
        <img src="img/design/PUB332/XCU Editorial-2.png">
        <figcaption>feature story editorial</figcaption>

        <p>
          I used a different approach for the main article design. Of course, I couldn't
          put a moving picture onto the page, but I wanted to have the feeling of movement
          across the page. So I clipped out an image of Emma Stone and laid it so
          it appeared that she was leaping out of the page. Other than a still from a movie,
          I could clip out images to have it look like there was movement through the images.
          Similar to the cover image, I edited the images to have higher contrast and saturation.
        </p>

        <p>
          The main title was inspired by old theatre and truck-stop signs. I did add
          a twist to this design, though. While I did want to keep older design concepts
          to match my moodboard, I decided to include more modern, minimalistic design
          as a mish-mash of times. Even though I want the title to stand out, I didn't want it
          to clash with the images and have the overall layout look too busy.
        </p>

      </div>

      <div class="box">
        <h3>additional content</h3>

        <p>
          In addition to the cover and the main editorial, I had also designed potential
          web designs, web advertisements, and a blow-in subscription card.
        </p>

        <h3>final thoughts</h3>

        <p>
          This project was really fun! This was a really different avenue from other
          design projects I have done because I was able to experiment with a different
          styles and maneuver my way through art direction. I found a lot of personal growth
          in my own design ethos and I even find myself adopting these concepts into
          my illustrations and photography as well.
