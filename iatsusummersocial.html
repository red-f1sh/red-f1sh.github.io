        <h2>IATSU 2019 SUMMER SOCIAL EVENT BANNER AND PROMOTIONAL MATERIAL</h2>

        <h3>project synopsis</h3>
        <p>
          Working with our two Director of Events, I designed the official event banner
          for our annual Summer Social event along with various promotional material.
        </p>

        <p><em>timeframe:</em> roughly three weeks</p>

          This design was for a student union social event.
          This event was marketed as a free event for all students within the
          university program, everyone was encouraged to join together at the beach
          and get to know their peers a little better at a summer barbeque. I wanted
          to create a representation of what the event could look like and send an
          appeal of a playful environment.

        <p>
          Before I created a quick thumbnail, I looked at the promotional material
          from the previous year to see what I could take inspiration from; while the
          previous banner had depicted the barbeque as the focus, I wanted to focus more
          on atmosphere and social aspect.

        <p>
          Personally, I like create my illustration before laying out text as I find
          it easier to place elements after I have a base image. I started with a quick
          sketch to lay out my illustration before adding colours.
        </p>

        <p>
          Again because I wanted to create a sunny, fun atmosphere, I decided to use
          warmer colours for bigger details- for instance, the boy under the umbrella.
          After creating the illustration, I then laid down grid lines to find “hotspots”
          in the illustration, I chose to practice Alexey Brodovitch’s design method in
          aligning text with parts of an image which stand out the most.

        <h3>challenges</h3>

        <p>
          Finding an appropriate font for the event banner was the most difficult for me.
          While I wanted to maintain some sort of minimalism to match with the rest of the
          artwork (vector art, lineless art), I still wanted a font that didn’t appear too
          stiff. Another challenge I had encountered was with text colours, originally, I
          had set the font as a flat white over the light blue background, which appeared
          stiff and almost unreadable due to lack of colour contrast.

        <h3>event outcome</h3>

        <p>
          As a result of marketing the event, the Facebook event page had reached
          around 90 people where roughly 30 had made it to the event. The event had
          been successful and the activities in our itinerary was held according to
          schedule.
