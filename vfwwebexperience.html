        <h2>VANCOUVER FASHION WEEK WEB EXPERIENCE REFORM (ACADEMIC)</h2>

        <h3>project synopsis</h3>

        <p>
          This was a semester project with a four-man team. We worked with Vancouver
          Fashion Week to design a solution for their dwindling viewership since the
          migration to a virtual platform. This project was overlooked by SIAT professor
          Ron Wakkary.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>timeframe:</em> three months
        </p>

        <p>
          We were tasked to collaborate with a participant group and to find a design
          solution involving interaction design. This semester, our team had reached out
          to Vancouver Fashion Week (VFW) and had done extensive research on ethnography, user journeys,
          and design personas. Through this process we had also hosted two workshops to aid
          our concept idealization and had narrowed down our initial brainstorm process
          to a final concept.

        <h3>ethnography research</h3>

        <p>
          To better understand the demographic of our target audience, we started off
          with a Google Form survey with the following questions:
        </p>

        <h4>demographic information</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>What is your age?</li>
          <li>What is your gender identity?</li>
          <li>What is your ethnicity?</li>
          <li>What is your involvement with Vancouver Fashion Week? (Options: organizers,
            fashion designer, buyer, media, influencer, model, hair or makeup artist,
            event set-up team, general audience member)</li>
          <li>What Vancouver Fashion Week events or activities did you attend or participate?
            (Options: fashion shows, designer interviews, networking events, afterparties)</li>
          <li>How often do you attend fashion-centered events, including VFW?</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>experience at VFW</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Can you describe a memorable moment you had at VFW? What made this
            moment memorable for you?</li>
          <li>What are you expectations of VFW?</li>
          <li>How would you describe your lifestyle outside of fashion week?</li>
          <li>What does Canadian fashion mean to you?</li>
          <li>What's something you would change about the fashion industry and why?</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>data collection & methods</h4>
        <p>
          <em>timeframe:</em> 4 days
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>5 semi-structured video call interviews (30 min)</li>
          <li>online survey sent to past participants (19 responses)</li>
          <li>informal interview with VFW representative (30 min)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <em>who?</em>
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>8 past general audience attendees</li>
          <li>3 model agency staff</li>
          <li>3 models</li>
          <li>2 from media</li>
          <li>6 event staff</li>
          <li>1 fashion buyer</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We had sent this survey to a variety of people, including those working with
          the organization and attendees. For the first section, we wanted to better understand
          what our intended users would be- aside from age, gender identity, and ethnicity, we
          wanted to know what roles our intended user group would play into VFW, and
          how prevalent they are within the fashion community.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the second section, we wanted to know about the general consensus of VFW.
          In our initial meeting with a VFW representative, they had already hashed out a
          basic rundown of their current issue- viewer counts have been lackluster since
          migrating to a online platform. A physical fashion show is vastly different
          from a livestream show, and we wanted to better understand why attendees
          valued their in-person experiences at these shows. In addition, we also
          wanted to know how respondants felt about the local fashion scene.
        </p>

        <img src="img/design/IAT333/ethnography affinity diagram.png">
        <figcaption>affinity diagram of our ethnography research</figcaption>

        <p>
          As a team, we had then taken all of our responses and put it together into
          a Figma file for affinity diagramming. In this process, we found that many
          attendees had inconsistent expectations with the organization of VFW shows, often
          finding that it was a bit disorganized with rude management. The portrayal
          of fashion week in media is also noted to be vastly different from what was
          actually featured at VFW shows. However, a main highlight of fashion week was
          the 10 minute break offered in between shows- attendees take this time to
          walk around and talk to others, taking this as an opportunity to network and
          create new connections.
        </p>

        <p>
          In terms of the local fashion scene, many people felt that Vancouver had
          an identity crisis in fashion. Fashion within Vancouver was focused on
          function rather than appearance; for example, techwear, athletic wear,
          and raingear is a constant staple within Vancouver. There isn't anything
          significant in terms of fashion and overall was geared towards practicality.
          We also noticed that many within the community wish to have more inclusivity
          within the industry and had raised concerns about fast fashion and the
          negative impact it has.
        </p>

        <p>
          With this information, we curated our initial design focus: <em>We want
          to explore the local fashion community's interconnectedness, its barriers to
          entry, and how we might better facilitate Vancouver Fashion Week's attendee
          interactions in a virtual space.</em>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="box">
        <h3>personas & user journey maps</h3>

        <p>
          Even though we have a good idea of who attends VFW, we wanted to make sure
          we knew who to target in our design solution. Despite already having a
          solid audience demographic, the VFW organization committee wanted to include
          creatives working outside of fashion as means to introduce them into
          the industry and allow them to break out their careers.
        </p>

        <p>
          We had a lot of struggles with this part because we initially weren't sure
          about what VFW meant by "young, non-fashion creatives." However, we did
          create a quick survey to send out to our peers. We wanted to know about
          how they felt about fashion, their creative aspirations or goals, and their
          interest in fashion and the local fashion scene.
        </p>

        <p>
          For our first iteration, we created three personas which we felt matched the
          original audience group we had interviewed: Kris, a social media influencer;
          Natasha, a VFW event manager; and Harper, a freshly graduated fashion designer.
          These personas were made on the impression that VFW had wanted to focus on
          their existing demographic.
        </p>

        <img src="img/design/IAT333/kris.png">
        <img src="img/design/IAT333/natashav1.png">
        <img src="img/design/IAT333/harper.png">
        <figcaption>initial design personas</figcaption>

        <p>
          Again, like mentioned earlier, this isn't the target audience VFW wanted, so
          we instead went back and reworked our personas. This time, instead of three,
          we created two personas. Our VFW representative had defined their ideal
          "young, non-fashion creative" as someone who has in interest in a creative
          field, but not necessarily in school for that career path. We took inspiration
          for our new creative persona from a local podcast called PressPlay, which focuses
          a lot on the underground creative culture within Vancouver. In this podcast,
          we learned that the local underground culture is very strong and how different
          communities and niches mix together.
        </p>

        <p>
          We replaced Harper and Kris with a new persona: Jeremiah, a budding musician
          who moved to Vancouver in hopes of jump-starting his music career.
        </p>

        <img src="img/design/IAT333/Jeremiah.png">
        <img src="img/design/IAT333/Natasha.png">
        <figcaption>final design personas</figcaption>

        <p>
          Moving on to journey maps, after touching in with our representative, we had
          set up a board in Miro to map out a potential journey through a livestream show.
          We marked the board with a variety of sticky notes to indicate different thoughts,
          actions, and other important details. Using this board, we made note of
          potential design opportunities.
        </p>

        <img src="img/design/IAT333/miro journey map.png">
        <figcaption>miro board for journey mapping</figcaption>

        <p>
          Similar to our personas, we made two iterations of our journey maps. For our
          first iteration, we made two separate maps signifying the journey prior to the
          livestream show and one during the livestream. Through our feedback session,
          we found that this design was not only difficult to read, there was a lack of
          clarity in events and design opportunites. Since we needed these maps to determine
          potential solutions, we needed to redesign these maps completely.
        </p>

        <img src="img/design/IAT333/v1journey.png">
        <img src="img/design/IAT333/v1journey2.png">
        <figcaption>initial user journey maps</figcaption>

        <p>
          In our second iteration, we separated our maps by persona- one focused on Jeremiah,
          the other on Natasha. It was made much easier to add more details for thoughts and
          design opportunties and we were able to have a better idea for different
          experiences for our two parties.
        </p>

      <div class="box">
        <h3>reframed design focus</h3>

        <p>
          Through our persona research, we discovered that our original design focus didn't
          fit the vision VFW had wanted and couldn't encompass the desires of
          our target audience group. In our surveys, we found that young creatives
          wanted connections and opportunities to expand their circle and find new
          clients. Many creatives had low interest in digital fashion shows as well
          since they didn't offer much benefits for those outside the fashion circle.
        </p>

        <img src="img/design/IAT333/IMG_1949 1.png">
        <figcaption>screen capture of VFW Instagram profile</figcaption>
        <img src="img/design/IAT333/vfwoglanding.gif">
        <figcaption>capture of VFW website home page</figcaption>

        <p>
          We had respondants look over VFW Instagram page as well during the interview
          process in which they responded that the content shared on VFW's page were
          either very lackluster, or just something one wouldn't see on a fashion
          show page. It was clear here that VFW's online presence was not very strong and
          that affected their viewership for online fashion shows. Furthermore, VFW's
          website is also very bland and doesn't have a lot of incentive for outsiders
          to want to attend a show. Instead of redesigning the format of the livestream
          show, what if we reworked the online presence of Vancouver Fashion Week?
        </p>

        <p>
          Because in today's world many people discover events and organizations through
          social media and the internet, we switched gears to focus on creating a
          stronger community through a virtual space. We modified our design focus
          to this: <em>How might we welcome non-fashion creatives to the Vancouver
            Fashion Week community by facilitating the interactions in virtual spaces?</em>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="box">
        <h3>workshops</h3>

        <p>
          With our new focus in mind, we conducted two 1.5 hour workshops- one with VFW
          organizers, and another with two non-fashion creatives. Even though we wanted
          to meet the needs of our target audience, we still needed to keep up with
          the expectations of the organizing team.
        </p>

        <img src="img/design/IAT333/workshopactivities (2).png">
        <figcaption>activities held during the workshops</figcaption>

        <h4>activities</h4>
        <p>
          All activities were taken from <a href="https://www.designkit.org/methods">
            Design Kit by IDEO.</a>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>card sort:</em> using a selection of provided images or images of
            your own, each participant arranges their images in any way which best resonates
            with their views of the prompt. Participants can add keywords or phrases they
            find important to add to their board. This activity was meant to find what each
            participant found valuable from digital networking experiences.</li>
          <li><em>mashup:</em> this activity involves a little more brain power-
            participants are to name aspects of the prompt (fashion, online communities,
            digital events) and qualities they want out of the aspect. They then name a
            brand or character which embodies the quality and mash up those answers into a singular
            question: <em>what is the [blank] version of a [blank]?</em> This gave us an idea
            about what participants want out of virtual events.</li>
          <li><em>spider:</em> participants are to write down any issues related to the
            topic chosen and map them out in a spider diagram. If possible, participants can
            also note down any solutions to these issues. All participants share their diagrams
            and vote for their top three ideas. The top three ideas are then moved on to
            a carousel activity.</li>
          <li><em>carousel:</em> continuing on from the previous spider activity, each idea
            will have a board where participants will spend 2 minutes on each board and
            brainstorm ideas on the issue. Afterward, everyone will take time to look at
            answers and discuss their thoughts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>findings</h4>
        <p>
          Creatives crave connections. More specifically, creatives yearn for positive
          affirmation from followers and other creatives, be that constructive and honest criticism
          or motivation to continue working. Creatives also want a curated, focused platform for
          discovery and sharing- there are many places to share works but are commonly
          oversaturated and can bar creatives from discovering other local creatives.
        </p>

        <p>
          On VFW's end, they want something interactive, collaborative, immersive, and fresh. During the
          mashup activity, organizers had voiced their desire to have energy similar to a
          concert or the Tomorrowland Festival at their events. They had even described their
          want to improve social media campaigns in order to attract new people. Overall, VFW
          wants returning viewership and clientele as well as more engagement on their social media.
        </p>

        <p>
          We narrowed our workshop takeaways to three design principles:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <em><li>build confidence in a platform for creatives</li>
          <li>integrate creatives authentically</li>
          <li>drive collaboration</li></em>
        </ul>

        <p>
          With these in mind, we reworked our design focus again- a re-reframed design focus,
          if you will: <em>How might we build a community surrounding Vancouver Fashion
            Week's digital event space that supports collaborative relationships and uplifts
            the work of young creatives?</em>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="box">
        <h3>concept brainstorm</h3>

        <p>
          We adopted <a href="https://idea-sandbox.com/blog/disney-brainstorming-method-dreamer-realist-and-spoiler/">
            Walt Disney's brainstorming method</a> involving the Dreamer, the Realist, and the Spoiler.
          This ideation process allowed us to think freely of ideas without restrictions
          and then coming back to dissect through different ideas and further improve
          on them.
        </p>

        <img src="img/design/IAT333/dreamer board.png">
        <img src="img/design/IAT333/dreamer board-1.png">

        <img src="img/design/IAT333/dreamer board-3.png">
        <figcaption>initial brainstorm session</figcaption>

        <p>
          We had whittled our ideas down to three concepts:
        </p>

        <img src="img/design/IAT333/Concept 1_ Activity Box.png">
        <img src="img/design/IAT333/Concept 2_ Reimagined Afterparty.png">
        <img src="img/design/IAT333/Concept 3_ Zine.png">
        <figcaption>first three concepts</figcaption>

        <p>
          However, we still weren't satisfied with these ideas. Both the activity box
          and the reimagined afterparty directly involved the event, but doesn't
          drive creatives to want to join the community even more, and the community
          zine doesn't directly involve creatives with Fashion Week and is more
          of an outside project.
        </p>

        <p>
          The overarching goal was to improve VFW's online presence and in turn
          bring in more viewers to their shows and these concepts didn't seem to fit
          into that criteria. So we moved back to our Miro board for another
          brainstorm session; this time, however, we decided to have a free-form
          brainstorm by freely jotting down ideas and expanding them as we go.
        </p>

        <img src="img/design/IAT333/final brainstorm-1.png">

        <p>
          We kept hitting a dead end; it was too difficult to create a new
          platform for VFW since it would drive away their current viewership, but
          their current online presence is preventing new viewers from wanting to join.
          Of course, we were looking at the issue the wrong way- we don't have to
          design a whole new platform, we could always work with what was given to us.
          We revisited VFW's Instagram profile and web landing page and started fresh
          from there.
        </p>

        <p>
          We re-envisioned VFW's current social media campaign. We took inspiration
          from Vancouver's ever-growing underground community and designed
          a rework of their website into a community hub site while still keeping
          to their brand. As their current branding doesn't accurately reflect the
          vision of their featured fashion designers, we designed a new art direction
          to attract new and old members to their page.

        <p>
          With this new design, attendees can now sign up for show updates, see
          featured designers, view the show schedule, and sign up for a
          newsletter to keep up with VFW events and news. In addition, we added a
          creator spotlight section where creatives can sign up for a chance to be
          featured on the site as well as a gig callout section for any
          job opportunities.

          Of course, VFW will have to build up on their online presence in order
          for the website to gain more traction. On their Instagram page, VFW can
          post profile roundups from their creator spotlight, creative opportunities,
          and local business highlights to further encite followers to check out their
          reformed website.

          In order to keep attendees on their toes, we also created mockups for
          a newsletter subscription and event reminders. For viewers who missed the
          live show, they can also view highlight videos on VFW's YouTube and Instagram
          Reels page.

        <h3>final thoughts</h3>

        <p>
          Upon our final pitch, VFW was very happy with our concept and wanted to
          utilize our proposed art direction to their advantage. Albeit slow, they
          are currently working towards improving their current social media presence
          on their Instagram page and hopefully in the future they can include our
          ideas on their website.
        </p>

        <p>
          This project was a very foreign process to me as I am not well versed in
          the fashion community. However, through this I have learned so much about
          fashion and how prevalent it is in our culture- even if someone isn't
          super vocal about their fashion choices, everyone's sense of dress is affected
          through trends in some way.
        </p>

        <p>
          As most focus was on art direction with this solution, I felt I was able to
          find a new way to express my design. There are so many different aesthetic
          choices in visual design, and to stand out a designer may have to take
          risks to create an effective visual.
